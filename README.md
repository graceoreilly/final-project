## Problem Statement
People with cognitive impairments often struggle with memory loss and disorientation, leading to frustration and a loss of independence. They lack easy access to these memories. There is a need for a tool that provides seamless access to meaningful memories, helping to improve recall, emotional well-being, and a sense of identity.

The app is designed for individuals experiencing memory challenges due to cognitive impairments, such as dementia, Alzheimer’s, or brain injuries. It is also beneficial for their caregivers and family members, providing a shared space to preserve and interact with important memories, improving communication, and strengthening emotional connections.

## Solution

This app helps individuals with cognitive impairments overcome memory loss and disorientation by providing an easy-to-navigate platform for storing and revisiting meaningful memories. It reduces frustration by organizing memories in a structured way, using images and short stories as prompts to trigger recollection and emotions. By enabling users to engage in meaningful conversations with family and caregivers, the app fosters emotional well-being, a sense of identity, and greater independence.
