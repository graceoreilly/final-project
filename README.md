## Problem Statement
Individuals experiencing memory-related challenges often struggle with forgetfulness and disorientation, leading to frustration and a loss of independence. They, along with their loved ones and caregivers, may find it difficult to recall important memories.

The app is designed for individuals experiencing memory challenges due to cognitive impairments, such as dementia, Alzheimer’s, or brain injuries.
